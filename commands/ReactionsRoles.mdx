<Info>
**INFORMATION:** You will need the Discord developer mode on for this.
</Info>

Firstly, send a message in the channel where you want it.

Copy the message ID of the message by right-clicking and then pressing "Copy Message ID."

Now, run the command `/reaction_role <message_id> <emoji> <role>`.

- Replace the "message_id" option with the ID you copied before.
- Replace the "emoji" option with the emoji you want for it; this can be either any of the server or from Discord.
- Replace the "role" option with the role you want to give upon reacting.


**This requires "MANAGE_ROLES" permsission.**
